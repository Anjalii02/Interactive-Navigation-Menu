#Interactive Navigation Menu

This repository showcases the implementation of an interactive navigation menu designed to enhance user experience through dynamic visual effects. The objective was to create a navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item, while maintaining a fixed position and visibility across all pages.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structured the navigation menu and webpage content.
- **CSS**: Styled the navigation menu and added visual effects.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented interactivity, such as changing the background color or font color of the menu.

### Features:
- **Fixed Position**: The navigation menu remains anchored at the top of the page, ensuring continuous visibility as the user scrolls.
- **Color Change on Scroll**: The background or font color of the menu dynamically changes when scrolled, providing a responsive visual cue to the user.
- **Hover Effects**: Menu items change color or style when hovered over, offering an interactive and engaging user experience.
